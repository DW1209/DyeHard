# Dye Hard

## Description
Dye Hard is a 2D Shooting-Survival game featuring a dynamic color-switching mechanic. As the player, the goal is to smash through obstacles while precisely matching their colors. Players have to switch the color of the ball to correspond with the obstacles that appear on screen. As the game progresses, blended colors (combinations of the original three colors) will start to appear so that players have to mix the colors based on their knowledge of colors.

## Control
- Aim ball with mouse position.
- Shoot ball with left mouse click.
- Switch player's color with number keys 1 (red), 2 (yellow), and 3 (blue).
